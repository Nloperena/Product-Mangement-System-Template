## âœ… Pre-deployment Checklist

- [x] Build process works (`npm run build`)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**"vite: command not found" error?**
- **CRITICAL**: Make sure Root Directory is set to `frontend-only` in Vercel project settings
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project Settings â†’ General â†’ Root Directory
- Set it to `frontend-only` and redeploy

**Build fails?**
- Run `npm install` first
- Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
- Ensure you're deploying from the `frontend-only` directory

**Routing doesn't work on Vercel?**
- The `vercel.json` file handles this automatically

**API errors?**
- The app runs in demo mode with mock data
- All API calls are simulated

4. **Monitor performance** via Vercel analytics
